Python Calculator Project ðŸ”¢

This project is a simple command-line calculator implemented in Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division interactively. The calculator can handle multiple operations in a continuous loop, making it easy for users to chain calculations together.
Purpose

    Practice Python functions and control flow.
    Demonstrate different implementations of the calculator, including:
        Without using functions for operations.
        Using functions in a standalone script.
        Using a dictionary to map operations to corresponding functions for cleaner code.
    Provide an interactive and user-friendly experience for performing calculations.

Features

    Basic Arithmetic Operations:
        Addition (+)
        Subtraction (-)
        Multiplication (*)
        Division (/)
    Looped Calculations:
        Users can continuously perform operations by chaining results from previous calculations.
    Input Validation:
        Ensures that only valid operations are accepted.
